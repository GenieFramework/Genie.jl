# Managing external packages for your Genie app

Genie fully takes advantage of Julia's excellent package manager, `Pkg` -- while allowing Genie developers to use any 3rd party package available in Julia's ecosystem. This is achieved by taking a common sense approach: Genie apps are just plain Julia projects. This can be easily confirmed by looking at the familiar `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files in the root of your Genie app.

In order to add extra packages to your Genie app, thus, we need to use Julia's `Pkg` mode:

1. start a Genie REPL with your app: `$ bin/repl`. This will automatically load the package environment of the app.
2. switch to `Pkg` mode: `julia> ]`
3. add the package you want, for example `OhMyREPL`: `(MyGenieApp) pkg> add OhMyREPL`

That's all! Now you can use the packages at the Genie REPL or anywhere in your files via `using` or `import`.

Use the same approach to update all the packages, via: `pkg> up` to apply all available updates, or `pkg> up OhMyREPL` to update a single package.

Finally, you can use `pkg> remove OhMyREPL` to uninstall a dependency.
